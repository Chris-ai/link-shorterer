# Shortly - URL shortening API

This is a solution to the [E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6). This project is a single web application to shorten links using the shrtco.de API. The site was built using a JS framework called `Vue.js`. The site is fully responsive and the `CSS`, written using the `SCSS` preprocessor is fully proprietary. I used a javascript library called `axios` to retrieve api requests.
